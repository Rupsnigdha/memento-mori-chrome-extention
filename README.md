I developed the Memento Mori Chrome Extension as a personal tool to incorporate Stoic philosophy and the concept of Memento Mori into my daily routine when I launch Chrome. Acting as a perpetual reminder of life's brevity, the extension prompts reflection on the fleeting nature of existence. By inputting your Date of Birth in the Options, the extension assumes an 80-year lifespan and initiates a countdown to that date. This countdown serves as a constant cue to utilize time wisely and focus on meaningful pursuits. Ultimately, it encourages contemplation of life's purpose and the aspiration to leave the world a better place than we found it.
